# FoodDelivery
This is a Java project that uses Spring boot, Mybatis-plus, Mysql, Redis, Html, and Vue.

The project focuses on building a website With CRUD functions. 
The project uses Spring transaction and propagation rules to make sure the database remains acid under multi-thread situations.
I also used Redis and Index to improve the performance of the project.

The project is composed of two parts: BackEnd Food management part and Front end user order part
BackEnd part provides functions to manage employees, dishes, combos, and orders
Frontend part is for users to order foods.
